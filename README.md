# Journal and conferences papers in a beautiful html

This is a set of scripts for creating nice preview page (see here:
<http://cs.stanford.edu/~karpathy/nipspreview/> ). It was originally
developed by [Karpathy](http://cs.stanford.edu/~karpathy/)  for all papers
published at NIPS. I have extended the functionality to JMLR and RSS.

#### Installation

So far, the installation and usage is pretty similar to the one you
can find in <https://github.com/karpathy/nipspreview>. However, I have
modified some parts to add new functionality. For example, there are
functions to automatically download all the pdfs from a volume of
proceedings. Besides, I'm moving to a modular desing so you don't need
to be calling several scripts sequentially.
