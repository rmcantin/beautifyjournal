# Journal and conferences papers in a beautiful html

This is a set of scripts for creating nice preview page (see here:
http://cs.stanford.edu/~karpathy/nipspreview/ ). It was originally
developed by http://cs.stanford.edu/~karpathy/ Karpathy for all papers
published at NIPS. I have extended the functionality to JMLR and RSS.

#### Installation

So far, the installation and usage is pretty similar to the one you
can find in https://github.com/karpathy/nipspreview . However, I have
modified some parts to add new functionality. For example, there are
functions to automatically gather the pds. Besides, I'm moving to a
module desing so you don't need to be calling several scripts
sequentially.
